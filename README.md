## Setup

Run `npm install` to install all required dependencies for the app

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

This command will require proxy-config.json file available in the root of your source code, usually this file has this format

```
{
  "/api": {
    "target": "address",
    "secure": "false",
    "auth": "username:password",
    "changeOrigin": "true"
  },
  "/": {
    "target": "address",
    "secure": "false",
    "auth": "username:password",
    "changeOrigin": "true"
  }
}

```

We have provided `proxy-config.example.json` file as an example, make a copy and rename to `proxy-config.json`

## Build
